# vcfmerge

A simple Python script to merge VCF contact files.

## Usage

**Simply run the script in the directory in which the contact files to be merged reside.**

*Make sure there isn't already a file called `merged.vcf` in the directory. If there is, the script will abort with an error message to avoid potential data loss.*
